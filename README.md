1. Make the Requirements Less Dumb:
Challenge every requirement and question its purpose, as requirements are often flawed regardless of who created them.
2. Delete Any Part or Process You Can:
Actively look to remove unnecessary parts or processes, even if it means potentially adding them back later.
3. Simplify and Optimize (in that order):
After deleting, simplify and optimize the remaining parts and processes.
4. Accelerate Cycle Time:
Once the previous steps are done, accelerate the pace of the process to increase the overall learning velocity.
5. Automate:
Finally, automate the process to lock in the improvements and gains achieved in the previous steps.
